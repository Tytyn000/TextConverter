# Converter

This is a simple text converter. It can convert from and to text, ASCII, Lowercase, Uppercase and Binary.

The project contains the Unity project and a Windows version.

Note : The translation from and to ASCII may be inaccurate because some characters cannot be displayed, are not available or do not exist.

It often takes the form of a sort of cube.

The Windows build is in 64 bit.
